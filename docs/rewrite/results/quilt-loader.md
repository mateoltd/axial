# Quilt loader handoff

Status: authenticated-sidecar correction, composed checks, real API lifecycle and qualified native gameplay/save/cold listing pass. The representative-version matrix and full release parity remain incomplete.

## Current Linux content and gameplay

2026-10-11, frozen Java-cause-fix API SHA256 `a0f2b06ca31bbccbe473a47409996473ee6fe53ed993d76ba9a58e2e8c70757b`, then unchanged `e8b44c20` AppImage SHA256 `118540d3b0de2596a81762b9466426c9a5748d5466be7fc9b75bd9529df23550`. Fresh offline QuiltParity/2GiB/Vanilla mode/optimization off installs Quilt0.30.1/MC1.20.1 with inherited Java17. One ordinary content operation installs Iris1.7.6 plus required Sodium0.5.12-beta.2,3,698,275 exact official bytes with schema3 provenance. Enabled→disabled→enabled and ordinary API cold reopen preserve exact files and receipts. BetterF3's unavailable Quilt-tagged Cloth dependency remains a refused plan; no compatibility bypass or manual jar copy is used. Initial omitted-field, affected-inode and runtime-link fixture assumptions are corrected through read-only reconciliation, without replaying writes.

The normal AppImage opens Ready/2 mods on isolated authenticated software X11. One native Launch visibly opens Minecraft1.20.1/Quilt0.30.1, enters newly created Creative world QuiltSavedParity, takes an F2 screenshot, saves to title and quits the game normally. Original Java3688125 exits0; the one accepted intent has durable terminal acknowledgement. Native Worlds lists the23-file/16,152,250-byte save. Close39924/0, normal native reopen, Ready/world listing and exact world hashes pass. All3,644 original protected files retain their identities, sizes and SHA1/SHA256/SHA512. Final Close5713/0 and display83617/0 leave no game/app/display process; both API originals87453/91592 also join0.

Compact proof: `.rewrite-logs/quilt-current/native-journey-final.json`, `native-game-settlement.json`, `native-cold-exact.json`, `quilt-cold-reopened{,-runtime,-public}.json`; visible evidence: `game-main-menu-visible.png`, `game-world-progress.png`, `game-save-menu.png`, `native-cold-world.png`. This qualifies the named API/native artifacts, not later Forge edits, physical graphics, audible playback, loaded shader packs, a performance comparison or full parity.

## Current native loader and mod journey

2026-10-10 to 2026-10-11, unchanged `4d5b86bb` product artifact from [Vanilla acceptance](native-auth.md#current-packaged-vanilla-save-and-cold-persistence), executable `cb390b85`. Native New instance selects Quilt/Minecraft1.20.1/Automatic and creates isolated JourneyQuilt `504a5fbd-abe3-42cc-abe6-88e66123f216`, 2GiB, automatic optimization off. Unlike the separately blocked Fabric endpoint, Quilt's live catalog works. Queue `3c974aa0-af08-49ca-8c22-9635593d19bd` installs Quilt0.30.1 against the existing base. A live menu Quit leaves that same operation active; a subsequent window Close visibly reports “Close is blocked while installs, launches or other application work are active.” Navigation remains usable. Downloads progresses from game publication0/1 to loader publication99%; the instance briefly shows Unavailable before converging to Ready without reload/Refresh. Public detail verifies the canonical loader identity, Ready, inherited Java and2048MiB, taking13.751s. No responsiveness pass follows.

One actual native Launch starts JavaPID51836/session `8529b192-be12-4128-956e-aef93126f27c`. Native Playing/live logs and public boot observation agree: Quilt0.30.1/Minecraft1.20.1 initializes mappings, renderer and sound. Native Stop produces Exited/stopped with tree settlement/output drainage, then durable acknowledgement. Ordinary Quit and cold reopen preserve exact checked metadata and Ready. Target-bound native Discover subsequently adds FerriteCore: exactly `ferritecore-6.0.1-fabric.jar`,125,197bytes, Modrinth `uXXizFIs`/`unerR5MN`, matching the provenance SHA512. The real Mods pane converges to Enabled. A second native Launch starts JavaPID53869/session `f5cdda4b-1a20-48fd-b2cc-e3a401003381`; actual logs identify FerriteCore6.0.1 among five loaded mods and initialize sound/renderer. Native Stop again settles/drains/acknowledges. These are real loader/mod startups, not a game-menu, world-entry/save, useful-performance or natural clean-exit comparison. Offline authentication401 and host-metric warnings remain recorded, not presented as warning-free authenticated play.

Native Disable renames the sole mod to `.jar.disabled` and persists disabled provenance. Ordinary Quit/cold reopen verifies both exact bytes and the Disabled row. Native Enable restores the original filename and byte-exact initial manifest; another Quit/cold reopen shows Enabled/Ready. Four launcher originals15259/32048/28072/74800 join0. Independent checks find all four launcher PIDs, both JVMs, four listeners and profile metadata/root-lease openers absent. The original Vanilla instance's complete row, prior intent/report records, account state, world/backup inventories, Bare Bones payload/manifest and options remain exact. New loader/setup records remain Ready/complete, both new launch intents are acknowledged, the queue is empty and no checked Content/Performance/driver obligation remains. Interface navigation preferences and the new instance's legitimate revisions/recency are outside that preservation claim.

Evidence is `.rewrite-logs/journey.UyTFoQoJ/quilt-*`; final helper `3b11e8a9` and joined0 `quilt-assertions.log` validate the recorded phases and current state. The first storage verifier incorrectly required zero retained creation-history rows; its script/failure are preserved, and the corrected verifier validates their terminal phases rather than deleting history or waiving obligations. First/second game log SHA256s are `a2d0a264`/`8aa6a82c`. No product/UI change, Performance application, interruption recovery, gameplay, other-version/platform, signing or full-parity closure follows. The normal packaged build intentionally omits the developer benchmark lab; no special lab-enabled artifact is substituted for this journey.

## Current integrity diagnosis

Read-only official-provider recheck at 2026-10-04T14:03Z reproduces the Quilt0.30.1/Minecraft1.20.1 mismatch. It also identifies a specific upstream cause: [MavenRepository.fileInfo](https://github.com/QuiltMC/update-quilt-meta/blob/cf90889394779ac7689a7b36f055695dc7893c56/src/main/java/org/quiltmc/meta/update/util/maven/MavenRepository.java) hashes checksum-file response bytes instead of decoding their text. [HashFunction](https://github.com/QuiltMC/update-quilt-meta/blob/cf90889394779ac7689a7b36f055695dc7893c56/src/main/java/org/quiltmc/meta/update/util/hash/HashFunction.java) confirms that operation.

The exact [Meta proof](https://meta.quiltmc.org/v3/versions/loader/1.20.1/0.30.1) SHA-1 equals SHA-1 of each raw40-byte official sidecar; that text equals the independently downloaded JAR's SHA-1:

| Coordinate | Meta SHA-1 / hash of raw sidecar | Sidecar text / downloaded JAR SHA-1 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `org.quiltmc:quilt-loader:0.30.1` | `d057a81ff6252a795ba688ddd2431e5f88df1b35` | `2fa21d6438f63c8dd40f2e81290b0a09de1442b3` |
| `org.quiltmc:hashed:1.20.1` | `24d6332c2ed45545c8c8622ecb14ccc3022cb873` | `2348b0ec7955c354ecb49f700b8a7b3f78e65a75` |

Matching SHA-256 and SHA-512 chains are independently reproduced too. Canonical sidecars are [loader.sha1](https://maven.quiltmc.org/repository/release/org/quiltmc/quilt-loader/0.30.1/quilt-loader-0.30.1.jar.sha1) and [hashed.sha1](https://maven.quiltmc.org/repository/release/org/quiltmc/hashed/1.20.1/hashed-1.20.1.jar.sha1). No artifact was executed or persisted, and no profile/source behavior changed during this diagnosis.

The existing Quilt proof owner now authenticates canonical raw sidecar bytes against Meta before decoding the artifact SHA-1. At most three required coordinates use the existing bounded transport, with a 40-byte body limit and fixed repositories; version data remains escaped. Missing, oversized or unauthenticated sidecars preserve the original direct-artifact pair. Authenticated malformed text refuses. Exact Meta size, coordinate, downloaded JAR verification and publication/receipt owners remain unchanged. No new dependency, cache, wire contract or recovery layer is added.

`core/app/src/loaders/quilt.rs` is the feature boundary. It uses the retained
`axial_minecraft` provider, catalog and installation code; it introduces no
parallel profile parser, Java rules, public DTOs or filesystem authority.

## Interface

- `fetch_supported_versions(&ManagedLibraryOperation)` returns
  `(Vec<LoaderGameVersion>, LoaderCatalogState)`.
- `fetch_builds(&ManagedLibraryOperation, minecraft_version)` returns
  `(Vec<LoaderBuildRecord>, LoaderCatalogState)`.
- `fetch_cached_builds(&ManagedLibraryOperation, minecraft_version)` returns an
  optional fresh catalog with the same records and state.
- `resolve_build(build_id)` resolves an opaque Quilt build against live provider
  authority. Invalid IDs and IDs for another loader fail before provider I/O.
- `install_build(&ManagedLibraryOperation, ManagedRuntimeCache,
  LoaderBuildRecord, FnMut(DownloadProgress))` returns the retained
  `LoaderInstallPublicationOutcome` or `LoaderInstallError` without flattening
  owned checkpoints or unresolved publication recovery.

Dependency: `axial-minecraft`; tests additionally require its `test-support`
feature and the existing `tempfile` dependency. The composition owner registers
`loaders::quilt`; the queue and shared installer own admission, progress,
cancellation, base activation and continuation. A base receipt is not a completed
Quilt installation. The retained continuation already contains the exact loader
plan, so it remains shared instead of being rewrapped per loader.

## Retained behavior

The leaf's Quilt provider uses the v3 metadata endpoint and preserves game
`stable` hints. Build labels, ordering and installed/build identity encoding use
the same retained catalog and metadata algorithms.

Installation refreshes the selected exact build and rejects record drift. Live
proof must match the loader version, game version, canonical profile ID, parent,
client main class and all three Maven coordinates: `org.quiltmc:quilt-loader`,
`org.quiltmc:hashed` and `net.fabricmc:intermediary`. The authenticated base keeps
its Java, client, assets and logging declarations. Profile attempts to override
those declarations fail. Library merging, platform selection, required-library
selection and conflicting merge-key rejection remain in the retained leaf.

For Quilt metadata, SHA-1 and positive size are either both provided or both
absent. Complete pairs are checked and normalized; partial or malformed pairs
fail. Absent pairs require fresh bounded library transfer and archive validation,
then the resulting exact SHA-1 and size are sealed into published metadata and
the receipt. An unchecked existing checksumless JAR cannot establish readiness.

Source references retained from the baseline:

- `legacy/core/minecraft/src/loaders/providers/quilt.rs`
- `legacy/core/minecraft/src/loaders/index/{query,normalize,cache}.rs`
- `legacy/core/minecraft/src/loaders/strategies/common.rs`
- `legacy/core/minecraft/src/known_good_libraries.rs`
- `legacy/core/minecraft/src/loaders/compose.rs`

## Verification

Root serialized checks pass **977 Minecraft /768 app /105 API /79 desktop**, with five app/seven API ignored helpers (`quilt-sidecar-{leaf-full,app-api-full,desktop}.log`). Independent final source review is clear. Scoped formatting and diff checks pass; no frontend/schema change requires regenerated contracts.

Six real loopback provider regressions cover authenticated raw bytes, direct-hash fallback, absent/partial tuples, malformed authenticated text, escaped version paths and dot-segment refusal. The composed installer verifies the resulting JAR and sealed metadata/receipt. Authenticated but wrong artifact digest or size reaches actual download and rejects publication. Chained historical mapping proofs reconstruct the installed activation sources exactly, without modifying managed files. Metadata-only reconstruction is not fresh artifact verification.

Meaningful RED is **11 pass/6 fail** against the original provider (`quilt-sidecar-red.log`), including the real installer checksum refusal. An undeclared `hex` call is corrected using the existing digest formatter without adding a dependency. A stale total-request assertion is corrected to distinguish metadata from sidecar reads; neither diagnostic is a behavioral RED. Final broad checks above pass.

Actual provider acceptance uses a fresh generated profile, exact Quilt0.30.1/Minecraft1.20.1 selection and the production API/queue. Initial harness mistakes used the loader display key instead of its wire component ID, then assumed a nested create response although it is flattened. The first refuses before mutation; the second occurs after one accepted creation. That existing instance/install is reconciled through read-only owner status, not another creation. These are harness errors, not product failures or acceptance proof.

Real official Quilt0.30.1/Minecraft1.20.1 installation succeeds through the production API/queue (`quilt-sidecar-live-observe.log`). Fresh profile `/private/tmp/axial-quilt-current.N1uZ6y/profile`, instance `4ceac07d-63e3-462e-baed-b5d16ea1cb36`, install `ca11db4f-b8b5-400b-ada7-7ed767285123`, operation `ed2075a9-6e4c-4ec5-918c-8a6e12f5be21`; terminal outcome succeeded and launch action Ready/Java17. API binary SHA-256 `d84dbe50719fd7fa8ca44948d5dadcd6e759422fdde4179912ec17ebd304c7cd`, provider source SHA-256 `643002fcc2734d1988227a1f41474b1856211df3e39abf9dad10387be63ee644`. Published loader and hashed JAR SHA-1/size equal the authenticated pair above: 3149891 and 798778 bytes. Sibling canary hash/native identity remains unchanged.

Actual offline launch uses synthetic `QuiltParity` and intent `6106aad2-a292-4c55-a1f4-18d8047f8afc`; session `3e804c7c-117e-4a62-8c2a-ce9438063fbc` reaches Running with JavaPID15647 and observed boot. Public redacted logs contain Quilt loading, LWJGL, OpenAL initialization, sound engine and atlas markers (`quilt-sidecar-live-{launch,session}.log`). Normal API Stop settles the tree/output, publishes stopped outcome, returns Ready and records matching durable report/terminal_ack1. Java is gone. SIGINT invokes normal joined API shutdown, exit0; ordinary reopen retains the same instance/version, synthetic account and Ready/Java17, with zero current sessions, then closes normally exit0 (`quilt-sidecar-live-{stop,reopen,reopen-observe}.log`). Published durable inventory stores the exact loader/mapping SHA-1 and size above. Sibling canary SHA-256 `5474cd8b8da140d1a758f371e4fe3f14a840b9c9f856db65aea6ce0a73d81a5c` and dev/inode/size/mtime `16777229:160426076:82:1791126315` remain exact. Generated profile/evidence are retained.

These production API observations prove real startup/lifecycle, not native Play or menu/world/save interaction; computer use was locked during that acceptance. Other representative versions, cancellation/interruption and native gameplay remain required. No legacy profile, user library or live native bundle image is modified by this correction.

## Current ordinary native lifecycle

2026-10-06, working checkpoint `ce56136f`. The normal optimized, uninstrumented ARM64 candidate built at `5c9fd5ce` has executable SHA256 `f6897fcc42524cb57eeeb39d16210459bbaeea4a556b4957a0cdab09fcdce5f8`; production is unchanged since `85742bb4`. Explicitly launch fresh `/private/tmp/native-quilt.2UyNfd/profile`, with telemetry configuration unset. Actual onboarding creates only offline `LoaderParity`, 2GiB and private/silent defaults. Native New instance offers enabled Quilt0.30.1; explicitly select it with Minecraft1.20.1, name NativeQuiltParity and automatic optimization off. One Create automatically installs; no second creation or enqueue follows.

Instance `035499f9-c322-4fc7-b515-77cef2ccbb29`, install `b178b7ab-d4ba-4974-b956-f838f0d968b1`, operation `7a81b4a9-f937-4550-8bc3-dd4511120f0a` reach actual Ready, terminal succeeded and child Final checkpoint. Base and exact child activations are ready and bound to that install/library/contract. The opaque selected build and installed version are retained in `native-quilt-observations.json`. The prelaunch witness verifies all7271 recorded entries, deduplicated into3643 files/762567900bytes, against exact SHA-1/size and canonical no-follow file identities/revisions. Both Quilt JAR pairs above match. This is recorded inventory, not an entire-profile or runtime-cache witness.

The initial frozen helper `6a74ecfd7530ab0852c79438da00435fe23b935039bf01fd90578009bed6e21a` times out at SQLite JSON escaping before inventory assertions. Exact bounded raw blob reads take14ms/12ms. The narrowly corrected collector preserves the10s deadline,4MiB per-inventory limit, total bounds and every proof assertion; independent source review is clear. Original helper and failed artifacts remain. Corrected helper SHA256 is `b25477692c0b4e599c1e18a4d744451c08cdbf43ec8508a9976965b037473b23`; successful prelaunch snapshot SHA256 `85b86d4d6057f520321c9725eda954c2c8414df09c89a9bde921e78a63f28789` predates the single Launch click.

Actual native Launch progresses Requesting → Starting → Playing. JavaPID1467 is owned by nativePID66546 and executes only from this profile's canonical runtime. Native Stop returns Ready with the launcher-stopped notice; Java disappears. Intent `21db2105-982a-494c-b829-9e003ae0c534`, session `0762abb8-1656-44c7-a99b-6cc129dbf563` have exact accepted-payload/settlement/report binding, observed boot18343ms, managed scenario, explicit Stop/signal9, no failure classes/dropped logs and terminal_ack1. Raw report SHA256 is `70e4a60b56069280d798c58324dae6c9a4b252e70947dde96011cd3d20baef5b`; launched/recorded times are00:13:20.313Z/00:14:11.983Z. Existing launch proof logic is narrowly retargeted, not a second settlement model.

Prelaunch-to-post-Stop recorded inventory, account/selection/settings/installation metadata, marker and sibling witnesses remain exact, with zero checked obligations/SQLite OK. An initial comparator incorrectly expects last-instance selection unchanged. The existing successful-launch owner intentionally updates it alongside recency; the corrected comparison requires this exact launched identity and retains all unrelated comparisons. Both results are preserved. This is not a field-level preservation witness for the changed instance record across Launch. No expected prelaunch record is reconstructed retrospectively.

Ordinary native-menu Quit exits session26003 with0, PID66546 absent. Explicit same-profile reopen uses PID11044/session94274, restores LoaderParity, exact Quilt0.30.1/Minecraft1.20.1 and Ready without reinstall, then ordinarily quits0. Both launcher PIDs and Java are absent. Full post-Stop snapshots, including instance/selection and the acknowledged history, are identical across both Quit boundaries and reopen: SHA256 `3ca2bd4b8854b8462c80821e7b1fc8026bdb9aebef5db1f3bed8a9f08ed372d6`. Runtime and successful collector-error logs are empty (`native-quilt-{installed-verified,stopped-proof,stopped-snapshot,quit-snapshot,reopen-snapshot,final-snapshot}`); observation chronology and original failures are retained.

No password, Microsoft sign-in, Keychain permission or signing action occurs. Post-startup computer-use inventory exposes no game app surface, so menu/world/save interaction is not verified. A subsequently attached user screenshot shows Minecraft1.20.1 “Invalid session” after Continue on the first narrator screen; account/process binding and the transition's cause are unconfirmed. This run's bounded game-log categories include authentication/Realms401, not proof of the displayed transition. See [the current session report](native-auth.md#current-game-session-report). This closes one ordinary native offline loader lifecycle, not a clean game-startup screen, authenticated, interruption, representative-version, installed-platform or full-parity acceptance. No speculative production/UI fix follows from these observations.
