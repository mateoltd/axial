# Screenshot files

Status: implementation integrated; bounded browser and native lifecycle/failure evidence below, not full parity verified.

Owned source: `core/app/src/resources/screenshots.rs`.

## Retained behavior

Baseline references are `legacy/apps/api/src/application/instances/resources.rs`,
its screenshot tests in `legacy/apps/api/src/application/instances/tests.rs`,
`legacy/apps/api/src/routes/instances.rs`, and the existing screenshot actions,
pane and lightbox in `legacy/frontend/src/views/instance/`.

- Inventory fields are `name`, byte `size`, and RFC 3339 `modified_at` (empty when
  unavailable), ordered newest first, then by name. The scanner is bounded at
  50,000 entries and 1 TiB of accounted file sizes.
- PNG, JPG, JPEG and WEBP are admitted with exact portable filename spelling.
  File bytes are preserved without decoding or recompression. Media is bounded
  at 32 MiB and must carry its image content type plus `nosniff`.
- Rename preserves the image type; JPG to JPEG is allowed. Portable aliases and
  occupied destinations fail without replacement. Successful rename returns
  `{ "status": "ok", "name": "..." }`; deletion returns `{ "status": "ok" }`.
- Filesystem paths and native diagnostics do not appear in public errors.

## Integration requirements

The composition owner owns root module exports, HTTP registrations, shared
resource aggregation and generated wire integration. The retained route family
is `/instances/{id}/screenshots`, `/instances/{id}/screenshots/{name}`, and
`/instances/{id}/screenshots/{name}/file`.

Filesystem calls require an exact registered-instance capability with its
library generation retained. Media authentication belongs to the transport.
Accepted work must outlive a dropped HTTP waiter and preserve unresolved file
effects. Names alone must never grant authority to arbitrary filesystem paths.

Requested dependency: `chrono` for the existing RFC 3339 timestamp format.
Focused command for the sole shared build owner:
`cargo test -p axial-app resources::screenshots`.

## Evidence

The historical shared checkpoint `42b2d598` passes 829 app / 117 API tests and hosted application/delivery checks. This includes resource owners and adapters, not every runtime screenshot journey.

The generated resource acceptance profile uses a disposable copy of the repository's 512-by-512 icon as `axial-disposable-2026-09-28.png` in instance `d6926227-f5e6-47a3-a736-f6c1cef14435`. The real Screenshots view lists 10,113 bytes and decodes the image in its lightbox. Rename updates both disk and the open lightbox to `axial-renamed-disposable-2026-09-28.png`, preserving SHA256 `88c17d7e98353f93809c2e0c68649823945b521f3cec25f46f9950833221ed7f`. A PNG-to-JPG draft shows the type-preservation error and disables Rename; cancellation leaves no JPG or other file effect. Evidence: `.rewrite-logs/screenshot-lightbox.png`, `resource-ui-files.log`, `resource-fixture-before.sha256`. This is an image fixture, not a game-captured screenshot.

Normal restart retains the renamed screenshot and exact bytes (`resource-restart-files.log`). Nested prompt inspection reproduced an inherited shared-modal issue: both prompt and lightbox claimed modal accessibility, and Escape closed both. The final correction uses the existing dialog owner to suspend the lightbox and cancel/restore focus without layout changes. On generation `660aaf2f2c4c`, real browser accessibility exposes only the foreground prompt, the input receives focus, Tab/Shift+Tab wrap inside it, and Escape preserves the lightbox and returns focus to Rename. Cancel preserves the type-validation behavior; a separate Escape closes the lightbox and returns to its View button. Evidence: `modal-dialog-browser.md`, `modal-dialog-focus.png`, `modal-dialog-escape.png`. Both acceptance API runs exit0 normally. At this checkpoint deletion, native folder opening and interrupted-publication acceptance remained open; the first two receive bounded evidence below.

## Current native acceptance

2026-10-04, source `068a60a1` with documentation checkpoint `df57757e`. Unsigned macOS ARM64 debug bundle generation `15b620ae006a`, executable SHA256 `9232f4dbd08939f716fc00a4fb9b66cbf08a6a9ee867a0259e23160df5555ef8`. Only generated profile `/private/tmp/axial-native-current.YwnWYB/profile` is used. Three fixture copies of the repository's 512×512 icon are 10,113 bytes each with the hash above; they are not game-captured screenshots.

Disposable source `4a2ecbc4-3184-480b-aa90-6d16dc057210` receives axial-native-disposable-2026-10-04.png and axial-native-collision-2026-10-04.png. Native PID97291 renders both thumbnails and the actual lightbox (`native-screenshot-current-lightbox.jpg`). PNG-to-JPG draft displays Keep the same screenshot file type and disables Rename; Escape preserves the lightbox. Submitting the occupied collision name refuses replacement with the existing resource-already-exists cause. Exact before/after file witnesses match, and no invalid JPG exists (`native-screenshot-current-{before,after-refusals}.json`, type-refusal/collision-refusal screenshots).

Renaming to axial-native-renamed-2026-10-04.png succeeds and updates the open lightbox. Original path is absent; destination retains the original file's identity, size and hash (`native-screenshot-current-renamed.json`, renamed screenshot). Normal Quit exits 0. PID6225 reopens the same profile and shows both expected PNG names without replaying a mutation (`native-screenshot-current-reopened.jpg`). Actual confirmed deletion of the renamed fixture removes it and selects its neighbour. Deleting the remaining collision fixture closes the lightbox and shows No screenshots yet. Another normal Quit exits 0; PID8269 reopens and retains zero screenshots (`native-screenshot-current-empty-reopened.jpg`). The non-image source-only fixture remains intact.

The separate Ready instance `41bd3f19-18fe-4716-9427-8a6ca93afd9e` receives axial-native-busy-2026-10-04.png. Actual native Launch reaches Playing with real Vanilla1.20.2/Java PID3462. Refresh and actual image decoding work while Playing. Submitted Rename and confirmed Delete both visibly refuse with the in-use cause, preserving the exact image identity/hash and creating no renamed destination (`native-screenshot-current-playing-{read,rename-refusal,delete-refusal}.jpg`, playing-refusals.json). Normal Stop returns Ready; session `f22a0070-d466-4fd8-ab2f-67e25b96ca38` has a stopped report, 4,462 ms observed boot duration and terminal acknowledgement (`native-screenshot-current-{stopped-report,ack}.json`). Java exits. The game is still absent from computer-use application inventory, so gameplay is not inferred. This instance's game-generated files are not claimed immutable.

Open screenshots visibly opens that separate instance's exact screenshot directory in Finder (`native-screenshot-current-folder.jpg`); its accessibility URL identifies the UUID and PNG. A computer-use stale-state refusal is resolved by refreshing state before the folder action. Spawn acknowledgement alone is not folder-display proof.

Native keyboard-only focus also passes: fresh lightbox initially focuses Rename; Space opens its prompt, Escape restores Rename, and Space reopens it without clicking or tabbing. Final cancellation again restores Rename (`native-screenshot-current-keyboard-{reopened-prompt,restored}.jpg`). Pointer-opened cancellation instead leaves the lightbox container focused; Space does not reactivate Rename, and a bounded read in the existing debug Web Inspector confirms DIV/role dialog. These distinct sequences are not conflated. Shared Dialog/Modal sources are unchanged since the earlier browser correction; no speculative focus override, retry layer or UI redesign is added. Submitted-response focus is examined in the follow-up below.

All three native processes exit 0 on normal Quit; final inventory has no launcher process. Final known-witness checks retain all 13 earlier source payload hashes, ten historical source identities, protected original options/sibling, the separate busy image, and absence of both deleted PNGs (`native-screenshot-current-{empty,final}.json`). SQLite quick_check is ok. These are named-file checks, not a whole-tree comparison; file-manager metadata is outside their scope. Only the two agent-created PNG fixtures are deleted; their bytes remain reproducible from the unchanged repository icon. At this checkpoint submitted-response focus remained open; the correction below supersedes that gap. Interrupted publication, bulk/selection/sort cases and installed-platform acceptance remain open.

### Submitted-focus follow-up

The same bundle/profile, PID21444, exposes a timing-dependent failure distinct from pointer cancellation. Keyboard-opened Rename succeeds to axial-native-submit-2026-10-04.png with functional Rename focus on the first submission; subsequent successful submissions leave focus outside the retained lightbox, and Space cannot reopen Rename (`native-screenshot-submit-{focus,second-focus}.jpg`). A bounded, temporary own-app Inspector trace records the same connected Rename button and panel: both animation frames after Return see body focus, Rename still disabled, and the panel unsuspended with aria-modal=true. Rename enables later without restoring focus (`native-screenshot-submit-timing.txt`). The existing Dialog consumes its one restoration frame while the resource owner still awaits PUT; cancellation had no such wait. This is an evidenced keyboard-containment defect, not a modal-remount or filesystem failure. Correction and rebuilt native verification were pending at this checkpoint; both are recorded below.

Temporary observers are removed. Actual Rename restores the original busy-image filename; its exact identity/hash and every earlier named witness match the pre-run record (`native-screenshot-submit-{before,renamed,after}.json`). Normal Quit exits0 and the process is gone. No file cleanup, admission change or production diagnostic is added.

Correction `06ac627a` stays in the existing Dialog return-focus guard: a still-disabled invoker uses its containing connected, unsuspended Modal panel. No response observer, retry, admission change or delayed second focus transfer is added. Composed real lightbox/action/mutation/Dialog/Modal tests hold the actual PUT boundary; slow success/refusal first fail at body-versus-panel focus, then all9 focused tests pass. Fast response restores the exact invoker; cancellation, replacement and deliberate focus remain protected. Full frontend passes436 tests with one existing Guardian TODO; types, affected formatting and lint pass (`dialog-submitted-focus-{red,green,frontend,types,format,lint}.log`).

The rebuilt unsigned macOS ARM64 bundle generation `fc6a05fe7e94`, executable SHA256 `ceb97a7cfdd5323680be5bed4e25c272bc0cbafc9c739a9276a48b0391afa7dd`, passes actual native verification as PID51896. Keyboard Rename succeeds with the lightbox panel focused; Tab reaches Rename and Space opens its prompt (`dialog-focus-native-{panel,reopened}.jpg`). Escape restores the exact enabled button. Actual Rename back to the original filename also succeeds with exact-button focus (`dialog-focus-native-restored.jpg`), retaining the same file identity/hash. Normal Quit exits0, no launcher remains, all named before/after witnesses match, and SQLite quick_check is ok (`dialog-focus-native-{before,renamed,after}.json`, sqlite.log). This closes the evidenced submitted-focus containment defect, not interrupted publication, bulk/sort cases, gameplay, latency or installed-platform parity.

## Browser sort, navigation and selection cancellation

2026-10-05, unchanged `849976bb` API/frontend and generated profile from [current-profile acceptance](current-profile-browser.md). The idle Fabric instance receives only three exclusive-created copies of repository PNG assets, not game-captured screenshots. The independent manifest records exact sizes, hashes, filesystem identities and separated modification times:

| Filename | Bytes | Modified, UTC |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| axial-alpha-disposable.png | 504 | 2026-10-03 12:00 |
| axial-beta-disposable.png | 11056 | 2026-10-02 12:00 |
| axial-zeta-disposable.png | 10113 | 2026-10-04 12:00 |

Actual Newest orders Zeta/Alpha/Beta; Name orders Alpha/Beta/Zeta; Size orders Beta/Zeta/Alpha. The actual lightbox follows Name and Size order, displays the correct1/2/3-of3 positions, and supports pointer Next plus Left/Right keys. All three images decode: live DOM intrinsic dimensions are32×32 for Alpha and512×512 for Beta/Zeta; the lightbox physically renders the repository icon. Escape restores the original View invoker. These are actual browser observations, not substituted hooks or a saved screenshot-file claim.

Keyboard-selecting Alpha/Beta and switching to Size preserves exactly those filenames. Actual Delete opens a two-item confirmation; actual Cancel returns the same selection/tray without deleting. Select all selects3; Clear removes selection, and Refresh retains all3. The bounded concrete file verifier checks all original hashes, sizes, identities and modification times after cancellation/navigation. No affirmative Delete is performed; confirmed bulk deletion and partial-failure handling are not established.

Exact API PID36782 ordinarily exits0 on SIGINT. Same-profile reopen PID45861 restores all3 images in Newest order and no selection. Before/after file witnesses match; Sodium/recorded game files and both prior reports remain exact, zero Content/Performance/queue/launch obligations persist, and SQLite quick-check is OK. Logs are `current-browser-screenshots-{before,after-cancel,after-navigation,before-reopen-proof,after-reopen-proof}.log` with reader `current-browser-screenshots.mjs`; inventory/report/state evidence stays in the linked current-profile report. No production/UI change, native opener, game capture, interruption or installed-platform parity is inferred.

## Browser affirmative bulk deletion and cold reopen

2026-10-08, ordinary API/frontend source `562c93601758ebd47873a36470bb5954edd68652`. Frozen API `/private/tmp/screenshots-bulk.MZveZ6Km/axial-api` has SHA256 `68c4a032a6bdc5b804e1aa028bfcad4ed3b52b6e7b9faa456889d352913f56e2`. Only generated current-app profile `/private/tmp/axial-browser-current.fAOlVA/profile` is used. One actual More → Duplicate acknowledges source `2d159a1c-e511-4319-952e-b9b29e69fc46` and creates `CurrentFabricParity copy`/`3eff4e50-57fd-47ef-ba34-4cb692cf3fa6`. The preservation baseline begins after Duplicate and exclusive copies of three repository PNG assets: `bulk-delete-alpha.png`504bytes, `bulk-delete-beta.png`11056bytes and `bulk-delete-survivor.png`10113bytes. These are image fixtures, not game captures.

Actual selection contains only Beta/Alpha. Delete opens the two-item disk-deletion warning; one actual affirmative Delete screenshots produces exactly two sequential completed DELETE200 responses, each `{"status":"ok"}`. The interface reports “2 screenshots deleted,” clears selection and displays only the unselected survivor, decoded512×512. Bounded CDP pagination reaches its final cursor without truncation or extra DELETE requests. `screenshots-bulk-browser.json` records root's actual observations, not an independent event recorder or saved screenshot artifact.

Reviewed private witness `screenshot-proof.mjs`, SHA256 `49e39e53dcefd76e1184c288cb2aeff78436239db6384b50d8fa6e4d11cac54c`, passes baseline/deleted/closed/reopened/final phases. All22 metadata-table hashes/schema, registry/history/current obligations, marker and every instance-tree entry remain exact except the two removed target PNGs and their parent's namespace, size, link count and timestamps; parent identity and survivor metadata/bytes remain exact. File count39→37. Each phase reserves cleanup, repeated observations and EOF probes before I/O within120s/4096 namespace attempts/1GiB reads/128MiB allocations; SQLite inputs/output/heap are separately bounded. Reserved reads are not measured physical disk traffic. Both review axes clear the helper's cleanup and heap-cap corrections. The retained first baseline attempt refuses after read-only metadata sampling because Apple SQLite returns0 for the requested heap cap; it is not deletion evidence or a product defect. The explicit existing `/opt/anaconda3/bin/sqlite3` passes bounded in-memory set/readback before profile I/O and retains the snapshot cap assertion, without fallback or installation.

API82184/frontend82208 normally join0 after SIGINT. Closed-state verification precedes cold startup of the same executable/profile as API22150; reopened-state verification passes. A fresh frontend22965 and actual browser reload/navigation display the sole survivor without mutation replay. Final normal API/frontend joins0 precede the final witness; recorded launcher/frontend/child PIDs, listeners and metadata openers are absent, and the temporary tab closes. The separate native launcher/game remain running and untouched.

Evidence: `screenshots-bulk-{fixtures,baseline-supported,deleted,closed,reopened,final,final-assertions}.log`, browser observations above, runtime/frontend and reopen logs, and final exit/listener/profile-opener checks. This closes the browser affirmative bulk-delete/cold-reopen journey, not partial failure, interrupted publication, native bulk/installed-platform acceptance, whole-profile immutability or full parity. No production/UI change is required. Only the two agent-created PNGs are removed; their bytes remain reproducible from repository assets.
